229 - :insert and :append

  In Vim, these two commands can indeed be given from within visual mode.

342 - /pattern/ ; /pattern/

  In Vim, this is from the first line containing pattern forward from the
  cursor until the subsequent line containing pattern after that first line.

  Vim uses the form: address <space> address   to accomplish what WAZ describes
  using semi-colons here. So, instead of his:

    /^WARNING!/ ; /^WARNING!/ delete

  Vim would use:

    /^WARNING!/   /^WARNING!/ delete


406 - 0 as initial address

  In Vim, this is not a problem. Zero can be used to start addresses.
